From the prior post:
*Earlier this year I came across a scenario of an application dropping connections. This was occuring across many hundreds of users and sporadically. Typically, I would attempt to recreate the issue so I could debug, but that was not possible here. I needed a way to be ready for the drop to occur and have all debugging tools setup proactively across a large number of users.*

*We use ConfigMgr to run scripts on workstations from a central location and it worked well in this scenario.*
